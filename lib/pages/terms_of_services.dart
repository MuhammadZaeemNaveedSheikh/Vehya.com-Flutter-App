Provisions 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 12-19 of these Terms of service shall survive any termination</p><p><strong>Notices May Be Provided Electronically.</strong></p><p>By use of the Website, you consent to receive electronic communications from us via email or directly to your account, and you agree that any such communications satisfy any legal requirement to make such communications in writing. You also agree that we may communicate any notices to you under these Terms of service, through electronic mail, regular mail or posting the notices on the Website. All notices to us will be provided by either sending:</p><p>(i) an email to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:ev@VEHYA.com">ev@VEHYA.com</a> or </p><p>(ii) a letter, first class certified mail, to VEHYA INC, 1420 Washington Blvd, Suite 301, Detroit, Michigan 48226; Attn: User Services.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Website or these Terms of service shall be filed within one</p><p>1:  year after such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred. If any provision of the Terms of service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of service shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable</p><p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong></p><p>We both agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and VEHYA INC arising in connection with or relating in any way to the Website, the Services or these Terms of service, or to your relationship with VEHYA INC or any of our Product Partners as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Services or these Terms of service) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration before a single arbitrator. We both agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Mandatory Arbitration provisions in these Terms of service or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. <strong>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. </strong>There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court, except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.</p><p><strong>BOTH YOU AND VEHYA INC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</strong> Unless both of us agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p><p><strong>Efforts to Resolve a Claim Before Commencing Arbitration.</strong></p><p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Our address for Notice is: VEHYA INC, ATTN: General Counsel, 1420 Washington Blvd, Suite 301, Detroit, Michigan 48226. The Notice must</p><p>(1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and </p><p>(2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, either one of us may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p><p><strong>How Arbitration Is Commenced and Administered.</strong></p><p>Once the procedure in Section 20 has been satisfied or the time has expired, either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between us will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and we both agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://adr.org">adr.org</a>, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. We can also help put you in touch with the AAA. All documents and information disclosed during the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p><p><strong>Where the Arbitration Would Take Place.</strong></p><p>Subject to Section 24 below, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, or the closest location in which the AAA is able to administer the arbitration. If the claim is for \$25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted</p><p>(1) solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator; </p><p>(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or </p><p>(3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.</p><p><strong>Who Pays for the Arbitration.</strong></p><p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, we will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US \$25,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. We will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the way the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. If we are the prevailing party, you will reimburse us for any arbitration costs or fees we paid on your behalf. Except as part of an indemnity obligation which expressly recites the recovery of attorneys’ fees set forth in these Terms of service, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees.</p><p><strong>Enforceable Terms.</strong></p><p>A motion to compel arbitration may be brought by either party in any court in any jurisdiction or venue in which an action has been filed. If the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 19 – 23 are invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree to the following provisions in lieu of arbitration: The exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall be the federal or state court in Orange County, California, and we both hereby agree and consent to such exclusive jurisdiction to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy related to these Terms of service in such jurisdiction and venue. You waive any defense of lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue or forum non convenient to a claim brought in such court; provided, however, that we may elect, in our sole discretion, to litigate the action in the county or state where any breach by you occurred or where you can be found. No action may consolidate more than your individual claims and you waive the right to have any court preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. You agree to limit any relief sought with the court to only your claims as the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by your individual claim</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous Terms and Conditions.</strong></p><p>These Terms of service and other agreements, rules, and policies incorporated by reference to these Terms of service, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between us and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and VEHYA INC regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of service. Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties, including but not limited to, Service Providers. These Terms of service are not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate this agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between us because of these Terms of service or use of the Website. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of service shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of these Terms of service.</p>
